# hugo-latex-as-image

This repository belongs to a Docker image which allows to generate LaTeX as images with a Hugo website.
For example, see <https://huijzer.xyz/posts/correlations/>.
I have added a small example site to show how it can be used.
To actually generate a website my advise is to use GitLab Pages.
GitLab Pages is much more versatille than GitHub Pages at the time of writing.

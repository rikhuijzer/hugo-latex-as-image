# hugo-latex-as-image

This repository belongs to a Docker image which allows to generate LaTeX as images with a Hugo website.
I have added a small example site to show how it can be used.
To actually generate a website my advise is to use GitLab Pages.
GitLab Pages is more versatille than GitHub Pages.
